# 🚀 Task 6: Static Website Deployment with GitHub Pages

This is part of my real-time **DevOps Internship at Elevate Labs**, where I learned to deploy a static website using **GitHub Pages**.

## 📌 Project Objective
The goal is to understand how static content can be deployed through version-controlled environments using GitHub — a simple yet essential skill in the DevOps lifecycle.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- GitHub
- GitHub Pages
- HTML5 & CSS3
- DevOps principles (version control, automation, deployment)

## 📂 Project Files
- `index.html` – Main webpage showcasing the task
- `style.css` – Custom styles for the layout
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🌐 Live Website
➡️ https://stanleyraj05.github.io/task6-githubpages/

## 🧑‍💻 Steps to Deploy
1. Clone or download this project.
2. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository.
3. Upload all project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `README.md`).
4. Go to **Settings → Pages** in the repo.
5. Under **Source**, select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
6. Click **Save**.
7. GitHub will provide a link to your live website.
8. 🎉 You're live!

## 💡 DevOps Insight
This task simulates real-world DevOps practices like:
- Using GitHub for version control
- Hosting applications through code repositories
- Automating deployment (similar to CI/CD in large apps)

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
Thanks to **Elevate Labs** for providing structured DevOps learning opportunities and practical hands-on tasks.
